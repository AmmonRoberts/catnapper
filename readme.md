# CATNAPPER

Catnapper is a silly text adventure game I originally made in high school using TI-83 basic.

I had a ton of fun making it back in the day, but lost most of the at some point, because I forgot to back it up, then my TI-83 reset...

I was super bummed when I realized that I would never have my catnapper again (I really didn't want to start over on the whole thing on a graphing calculator...), and always wanted to remake it again.

I started making a fun version with a UI using C#, but lost steam.

That brings us to the present time!

I was wanting to expand my GitHub while also learning something new, so I decided I would learn Ruby and make my game again!

And here it is!

## Instructions:
- Download all or just part of the repo
- Run catnapper.rb using Ruby

OR

- Run catnapper.exe without ruby
- Enjoy!
